abstract = {In filamentous fungi, the formation of hyphal branches is a critical process that supports the ability of mycelia to radiate across and colonize growth substrates. Branching can occur at hyphal tips (apical branching) or from subapical hyphal compartments (lateral branching). The primary focus of this review is on lateral branching. Current understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of lateral branches is summarized. This includes emphasis on the spatial regulation of branch formation as well as the roles of the morphogenetic machinery in branch emergence. An improved understanding of hyphal branching will provide greater insight into the morphological differentiation of fungal mycelia.}

SUMMARY 
Filamentous fungi constitute a large group of eukaryotic microorganisms that grow by forming simple tube-like hyphae that are capable of differentiating into more-complex morphological structures and distinct cell types. Hyphae form filamentous networks by extending at their tips while branching in subapical regions. Rapid tip elongation requires massive membrane insertion and extension of the rigid chitin-containing cell wall. This process is sustained by a continuous flow of secretory vesicles that depends on the coordinated action of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons and the corresponding motors and associated proteins. Vesicles transport cell wall-synthesizing enzymes and accumulate in a special structure, the Spitzenkörper, before traveling further and fusing with the tip membrane. The place of vesicle fusion and growth direction are enabled and defined by the position of the Spitzenkörper, the so-called cell end markers, and other proteins involved in the exocytic process. Also important for tip extension is membrane recycling by endocytosis via early endosomes, which function as multipurpose transport vehicles for mRNA, septins, ribosomes, and peroxisomes. Cell integrity, hyphal branching, and morphogenesis are all processes that are largely dependent on vesicle and cytoskeleton dynamics. When hyphae differentiate structures for asexual or sexual reproduction or to mediate interspecies interactions, the hyphal basic cellular machinery may be reprogrammed through the synthesis of new proteins and/or the modification of protein activity. Although some transcriptional networks involved in such reprogramming of hyphae are well studied in several model filamentous fungi, clear connections between these networks and known determinants of hyphal morphogenesis are yet to be established.

    abstract = { ABSTRACT Filamentous fungi are a large and ancient clade of microorganisms that occupy a broad range of ecological niches. The success of filamentous fungi is largely due to their elongate hypha, a chain of cells, separated from each other by septa. Hyphae grow by polarized exocytosis at the apex, which allows the fungus to overcome long distances and invade many substrates, including soils and host tissues. Hyphal tip growth is initiated by establishment of a growth site and the subsequent maintenance of the growth axis, with transport of growth supplies, including membranes and proteins, delivered by motors along the cytoskeleton to the hyphal apex. Among the enzymes delivered are cell wall synthases that are exocytosed for local synthesis of the extracellular cell wall. Exocytosis is opposed by endocytic uptake of soluble and membrane-bound material into the cell. The first intracellular compartment in the endocytic pathway is the early endosomes, which emerge to perform essential additional functions as spatial organizers of the hyphal cell. Individual compartments within septated hyphae can communicate with each other via septal pores, which allow passage of cytoplasm or organelles to help differentiation within the mycelium. This article introduces the reader to more detailed aspects of hyphal growth in fungi. }

It also demonstrates a simple mechanism for hyphal swelling and beading that is observed in the presence of a lysing agent.}

abstract = {We developed a three-dimensional model of hyphal morphogenesis under the same basic assumption used for the construction of a two-dimensional model. Namely, that the polarized growth of tubular cells (hyphoids) arises from a gradient of wall-building vesicles generated by a vesicle supply center (VSC). Contrary to the 2-D mathematical formulation, the three-dimensional derivation led to an indetermination whose solution required defining a priori the pattern of expansion of the wall, i.e. defining the overall spatial movement of the wall as the newly inserted wall elements displace the existing wall fabric. The patterns of wall expansion can be described by tracing the movement of marker points on the cell surface (point trajectories). Point trajectories were computed for three different modes of wall expansion of the VSC-generated hyphoids: orthogonal, isometric, and rotational. The 3-D VSC models allowed us to either stipulate or calculate the degree of anisotropy for each type of wall expansion. Wireframe models were built to visualize growth anisotropy in each model. Although the overall shape of the three hyphoid models is similar, they differ substantially in point trajectories and anisotropy. Point trajectories are experimentally testable and were the basis for the conclusion that hyphae grow in orthogonal fashion. (Bartnicki-Garcia et al., 2000. Biophys. J.79, 2382–2390.)}
